# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
   - **Project Manager** leads coordination
   - **Product Manager** presents vision and requirements
   - **Technical Lead** discusses technical approach
   - **Scrum Master** explains Agile process and ceremonies
   - **UX Designer** shares design vision and standards
   
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
   - **Product Manager** defines and prioritizes
   - **UX Designer** contributes usability requirements
   - **QA Engineer** contributes testability considerations
   
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
   - **Developers** and **Technical Lead** provide estimates
   - **QA Engineer** estimates testing effort
   - **Scrum Master** facilitates estimation sessions
   
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
   - **Scrum Master** facilitates team agreement
   - **QA Engineer** defines quality criteria
   - **Technical Lead** defines technical standards
   
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
   - **Technical Lead** maps technical dependencies
   - **Project Manager** tracks cross-team dependencies
   
6. Create release plan and milestone map
   - **Project Manager** coordinates timeline
   - **Release Manager** plans deployment windows
   - **Product Manager** aligns with business milestones

**Cross-Reference**: See [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed responsibilities of each role in planning activities.

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
**Scrum Master** facilitates sprint planning with the team.

- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- **Product Manager** presents prioritized backlog items
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- **Developers** and **Technical Lead** assess technical feasibility
- **QA Engineer** ensures testing capacity and testability
- **UX Designer** clarifies design requirements for selected items
- Ensure team capacity is respected
- **Scrum Master** confirms sprint goals and commitments

**Cross-Reference**: See [Scrum Master role](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#scrum-master) for sprint ceremony facilitation details.

## Risk & Dependency Management
**Project Manager** maintains the risk register with input from all roles.

- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
  - **Technical Lead** identifies and owns technical risks
  - **QA Engineer** identifies quality and testing risks
  - **Release Manager** identifies deployment and release risks
  - **UX Designer** identifies usability and design risks
  
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board
- **Project Manager** escalates dependencies during weekly syncs
- **Scrum Master** tracks and communicates impediments from daily standups

**Cross-Reference**: See [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) for detailed escalation paths and risk lifecycle.
