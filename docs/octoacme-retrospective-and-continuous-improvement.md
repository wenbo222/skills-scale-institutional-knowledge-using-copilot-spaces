# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
**Scrum Master** facilitates retrospectives to ensure productive discussion and actionable outcomes.

- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- All roles participate: **Developers**, **QA Engineer**, **Technical Lead**, **UX Designer**, **Product Manager**, **Project Manager**
- **Scrum Master** ensures psychological safety and balanced participation
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- **Scrum Master** documents outcomes and assigns owners

**Cross-Reference**: See [Scrum Master role](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#scrum-master) for continuous improvement facilitation details.
